NOTES: Bootstrap lays out EVERYTHING!! in grids. 

Also you make your whole website just by making div classes pretty much, then it does everything for you. 

And the total page is always 12 units wide, so these col-lg-6 etc kinda titles mean that when the screen is "lg" large then this column data will take up half of it (6/12) and on and on for the other sizes of screens (pc screens, tablets, phones, etc). 

EASY!!
