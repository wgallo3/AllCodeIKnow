Server based, so it was good to have learned but won't be applicable to future decentralized projects..... RIGHT????

Unless the things can be adapted???

Wait no, because it is based on SQL.db and other reg databases.... SAFE is the db..... Wonder if this could be rigged up???? :D

Maybe worth it cuz Django auto-creates templates, etc. has great features!!
